# üéπ MidiAI: AI-Driven Python MIDI Music Generator

**Date of Origin:** 2025-06-24

## üéµ About the Project

**MidiAI** is an experimental Python project designed to explore the capabilities and limitations of AI-generated MIDI music composition. Leveraging AI-generated Python code, MidiAI creates dynamic and diverse musical compositions, ranging from entirely random sequences to structured pieces inspired by musical theory and authentic cultural rhythms.

This is not a finished works, it is a continuing living project that evolves as the participants and AI evolves.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Generated Code & Music:** All Python code and MIDI interpretations are entirely generated through AI prompts.
- **Diverse Compositions:** Explore compositions including random melodies, structured theory-based sequences, and authentic culturally-inspired rhythms.
- **Real-Time MIDI Playback:** Seamlessly integrates with MIDI devices, software synthesizers, and built-in soundcards.

## üìú Project Rules

1. **Fully AI-Generated:** The musical code must be completely generated through AI prompts‚Äîno manual intervention or direct MIDI notation insertion.
2. **Exploratory Purpose:** The goal is experimentation, innovation, and exploration‚Äînot merely playing existing MIDI files.
3. **Originality:** Legally permissible inspiration or copying is acceptable if clearly AI-driven.
4. **Progression:** Files MUST be saved sequentially with numbers.  We want to show the evolution of the journey.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

MidiAI requires a MIDI-compatible playback environment:
- MIDI equipment (keyboards, synthesizers, etc.)
- Built-in PC soundcard wavetable
- Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth or similar software synths

### Installation:

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/verifie/MidiAI.git
cd MidiAI
```

2. Install dependencies (listed at the top of each Python file):
```bash
pip install python-rtmidi
```

3. Run the Python scripts:
```bash
python midi_composer.py
```

## üåü How It All Began

MidiAI originated as an experiment in creating perpetual 80s-style synth-pop music purely through random generation via AI prompts. The initial results were predictably chaotic and sometimes humorously painful to listen to, but provided valuable insights into the potential and limits of AI-driven music.

Since then, it has evolved significantly, incorporating structured theory, rhythmical complexity, and authentic cultural patterns.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Listening Advisory

Some initial experiments (especially the earliest 80s compositions) can be challenging to listen to due to their raw, unstructured nature (they are rubbish). Later versions, however, offer rich, culturally authentic rhythms and engaging polyrhythmic complexities - well not quite, but its all a work in progress!

Enjoy exploring MidiAI and the evolving frontier of AI-driven musical creativity!
